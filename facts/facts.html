                <li>A web server is a computer program that serves requested HTML pages or files to a client.</li>
                <li>Some popular web servers include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft's IIS.</li>
                <li>In addition to serving HTML pages, a web server can also handle other types of files such as images and videos.</li>
                <li>Some web servers can also function as a reverse proxy, which can help improve performance and security by handling tasks such as load balancing and SSL/TLS termination.</li>
                <li>Some web servers can also be configured to handle multiple websites on the same IP address, using a technique called virtual hosting.</li>
                <li>Web servers can also be used to host web applications, which are programs that are executed on the server and interact with a database to provide dynamic content to users.</li>
                <li>Web servers use the HTTP protocol to communicate with clients, and the HTTPS protocol to provide secure communication over the internet.</li>
